# multi_linear_regression


This repository hosts a dataset encapsulating various financial aspects and the location of a range of startups.
The dataset has been used for researching the influence of these factors on startup profitability using a Multiple Linear Regression model.

##Dataset Description

The dataset comprises five key variables:

R&D Spend: The annual expenditure on research and development.
Administration: The annual administrative expenses.
Marketing Spend: The annual expenditure on marketing.
State: The location of the startup.
Profit: The annual profit made by the startup.
These variables reflect the investment in key operational areas and the resulting profit, alongside the startup's location.

##Methodology

I used a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate the relationship between the spendings on various sectors (R&D, Administration, and Marketing) and the profit of a startup,
taking into account its location.
